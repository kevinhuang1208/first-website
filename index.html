        <h2>Short and Sappy Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Life, to say the least, have definitely been a roller coaster of a ride. However, I don't regret a single thing that I did thus far because if it wasn't for those instances, I would not be where I am now with absolute clarity of my career aspirations. Enough of the introductions though... Here is a website about why I am proud to and forever will be a Bostonian!

        <h2>Everyone's First Impression of Boston</h2>
        <p>
            If you're not from Boston, you will never know how it feels like to be assumed that you have a Boston accent, or use the term "wicked" in every sentence we say. Not cool... <strong>BUT</strong>, I do have to admit, sometimes, and I do mean sometimes because it is <em>very</em> situational, it feels good to say "wickEDDD" to something real hype or "pahked the cah in hahvud yahd" when imitating a "Bostonian". Only we get those privileges though :). Anywhom, this website will tell you that we have more than just that. We are a diverse and friendly group of people who will help you out if you're a quarter short for the train (I will, at least). Sit back and enjoy!
